Note:
TyperShark game
GUI prog report

Our program:

-can instantiate scuba diver(or the player) at a given position in the frame
-can instantiate one shark with a given position in the frame and with a given speed
-has JPanel on the North part of the frame where the score, level and life will be displayed
-can instantiate groups of sharks(not just one) with different yPos.
-has background picture
-can have randomized words inside Shark objects

-has implemented keyListeners
-has panel on the bottom that displays the current word the user is typing
-has piranhas (and can instantiate them multiple times like the shark)
-increase points on every shark/piranha kill
-life decreases when shark reaches the end of the map

-existing bug was removed; game needs to have a background image so it would disappear

-input is now limited; letters can only be typed
-input is automatically set to small caps

- has an added DepthTimer class:
    > timer-based used to keep track of the depth of the player
    > panel on the left or west part, where the level/depth of the ocean can be seen
- can arrange the classes into a package file :3
- has player animated sprite
- modified the UnderWater class:
	> whenever the depth increases, the background image gets darker and darker in blue
- removed the Word interface: the interface isn't useful


05/21 Updates:
	-has a Boss level wherein the boss fires missiles to the scuba diver. This is at level 15(final level)
	-The missiles being fired by the boss will change direction whenever the user typed the word correctly. This can decrease the boss' life once the missile reaches the boss.
	-This, however, will decrease the player's life if the user is not able to type the word correctly.
	-the game ends if the player dies, life < 0

05/22 Updates:
	-asks the name of the user after the game
	-saves the score of the player after finishing/losing the game regardless if top score or not
	-saving is still terminal based

BUGS:
	> SeaCreature moves at a different y-position whenever a key is pressed
		Cause: unknown
		Solution: added a background image
	>
